42fs
======

Create a FUSE filesystem using the 42 lab computers that allows students to access each other's `public` folders.

Files: all project files

You will need to create 3 binaries.

 - Client utility - assists with setup
 - FUSE daemon - provides the filesystem
 - Coordination server - to connect clients with each other


Requirements:

The coordination server must not serve files, they must come from the other lab computers
The computer serving files must respect Unix access permissions (other-read...)
The filesystem should be structured like this:

    ~/public/<login>/<file...>

You should probably store the user's own files in their NFS directory...


Bonus:

The coordination server serves the files if the other person isn't signed in
